#The Nexmo Verify SDK

You use Nexmo Verify to check that a person has access to a specific phone number.

To complete phone verification:

1. Verify sends a PIN in an SMS and/or Text-to-speech (TTS) call to your user.
   You can also enable Google Cloud Messaging (GCM) in order to send a PIN using push notifications.
2. The user enters this PIN into your App or website.
3. You use Verify to check that the PIN entered by your user is the one you sent.

Using the Nexmo Verify SDK you easily integrate Verify functionality into your Android App. With the Nexmo Verify SDK, you enter the user's phone number and the SDK completes verification for you.

In order to integrate the Nexmo Verify SDK in your App, see:
